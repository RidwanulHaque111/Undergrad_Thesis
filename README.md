# Unveiling Crop Diversity through Bat Algorithm-Driven Framework for Multispectral Satellite Image Analysis

This repository contains my research work for classifying crop diversity from multispectral satellite images based on different neural network models and Bat-Algorithm optimization.

Crops are primary source of food, contributing to global nutrition and supporting various industries.
As different Crop Variety provides different nutrition, Understanding and classifying crops are essential for optimizing resources.
Neural network models can be used to classify crops from satellite images. 

## Why Use Satellite Images for Crop Classification?

* Large-Scale Crop Coverage: Satellite images provide comprehensive coverage of agricultural areas, allowing for the analysis of large expanses of farmland.
* Temporal Monitoring: Satellites capture images over time, enabling the monitoring of crop growth stages, changes, and seasonal variations.
* Remote Sensing: Satellite-based remote sensing offers a non-invasive way to collect data, reducing the need for physical field surveys.
* Timely Information: Satellite imagery provides real-time or near-real-time information, crucial for making timely decisions in agriculture.
